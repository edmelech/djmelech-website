        Ed Melech (also known as Cyrus to some) is a resident DJ for London venues Loulou's, Sketch, The Ned, Folie and El Camion. 
        <br/><br/>
        For over 10 years he has been playing regularly across the London circuit as well as private parties throughout the UK and Europe. In 2021 these included parties in a medieval castle and a Scillian grotto. 
        <br/><br/>
        Constantly searching for new tunes and forgotten classics, Melech focuses his DJ sets on underground house, disco and beyond.
